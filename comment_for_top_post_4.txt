Z0V4: I have always loved whips ever since I first saw Indiana Jones. I loved them so much that I studied the reason that they work and taught myself how to make short 6ft whips out of Paracord, electrical tape, and BBs. I learned how to use them the hard way and still have a couple scars to show for it.

 It always fascinated me why whips work at all, put simply, Force = Mass x Acceleration. This is why whips are made with a taper that gets smaller as it reaches the tip, essentially you're putting Force into the handle by flicking your wrist. As that Force travels down the length, the mass it travels through is getting smaller so the Acceleration has to increase to balance the equation F=MA. As the force reaches the tip where the mass is the smallest, the Acceleration has increased exponentially from the relatively small amount of force your wrist/arm put into the handle. This gets the tip well above the speed required to break the sound barrier, but the actual crack isn't just from reaching that speed, but from the air waves getting trapped in front of the whips tip and collapsing into each other as the tip reaches it's full length and pulls back on itself. This is why it's a sharp/short cracking sound instead of the roaring sound you would hear from a jet continuously flying at mach 1. 

Studying whips taught me more about physics than any science class ever did!
--- MuffinLordGuardian: This dude whips
--- sargsauce: I made a paracord whip, too! I use it to scare off hawks when I hear them making their hawky calls in the vicinity of my chickens.
--- --- Empero6: *hawky sounds*
--- --- --- sargsauce: You motherfucker! *abandons work meeting to whip at the air*
--- --- --- --- slytorn: YOU BOYS QUIT ALL THAT WHIPPIN' NOW!
--- djkutch: I, too, made such a whip to be Jones for Halloween.
--- flipflapslap: Holy shit. This is an awesome comment, thank you for sharing.
--- fistkick18: Ummm... You shouldn't flick your wrist when you crack a whip. That's a great way to get it to fail to crack. You should use your entire arm, and simply follow through. The whip will crack itself, and you won't get hurt. 

Also part of what helps make a really nice sound is the cracker, which has to be replaced every so often as it breaks.
--- Markus_97: Passion of the christ sure made me hate them
--- Pay08: Your science class didn't teach you basic physics?
TraptorKai: I thought the first invention to break the sound barrier was the peasant rail gun
--- radioarchipelago: wtf are you talking about?
--- --- RusstyDog: It's a joke from Dungeons and Dragons created by incorrectly applying physics to only part of a reaction.


The idea is that in D&amp;D, a single round of combat is 6 seconds long, and all player/enemy actions in that round happen simultaneously.

So, you get a group of 10,000 peasans and have them stand shoulder to shoulder in a line. Give the first one a stone and have it pass the stone to the next, and so on. Because the stone is theoretically moving over 10,000 feet in the span of 6 seconds, it would have accelerated to the point of being an extremely fast and deadly projectile.
--- --- --- Cpt_Woody420: And then you realise that a thrown rock deals 1 damage, regardless of how fast its going.
--- --- --- --- RusstyDog: Also, even if you go the realistic physics route, the rock would be going so fast it would shatter the hand of person 3.
--- --- --- --- --- piratep2r: Being a peasant is a tough job, mate.
--- --- --- OGraffe: DnD rules lawyering is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
--- --- --- --- wedgebert: Don't even need to rules lawyer. An 11/2 Ranger/Fighter can attack 16 times in six seconds (whirlwind while surrounded + action surge).

Or worse, an 18th Cavalier is only limited by the number of targets. They can make an opportunity attack without using their reaction, so they can attack basically an infinite number of times so long as creatures keep past them.
--- --- --- --- --- Black_Moons: &gt;Or worse, an 18th Cavalier is only limited by the number of targets. They can make an opportunity attack without using their reaction, so they can attack basically an infinite number of times so long as creatures keep past them.

Technically that is just holding your sword out for people to run into.
--- --- --- --- --- --- Adghar: He ran into my knife. He ran into my knife 48 times.
--- --- --- --- --- --- AyoRobo: It was an accident, your honor.
--- --- --- --- --- poqpoq: 16 times in 6 seconds is within realism range for dagger stabs/ slashes/strikes.

Pretend you are dual wielding and going ham in the air. Can even do that that many attacks with a single arm if you limit it to stabs.
--- --- --- --- --- --- wedgebert: Not against eight different people though. Whirlwind is one attack per adjacent enemy. 

And during this time you're being attacked, dodging, taking hits, etc. Try the same going ham on the air, but have eight friends surround you and swing nerf bats at you while you try not to get hit and attacking each of them twice
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- poqpoq: Okay fair. Wasn‚Äôt familiar with the circumstances/rules. Never found a D&amp;D group to get into it with.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- wedgebert: It's still not as bad as the alternate Volley ability which lets you attack **all** enemies within 10' of a point you specific (so a 20'x20'x20' cube if you point in the air depending on how you handle diagonals). 

If you're targeting tiny creatures who can (DM ruling dependent) share a square with four other creatures, that's 64 squares with 4 targets each for 256 attacks. Then you action surge like before and now you can make 512 attacks.

Now your DM might rule against the space sharing, so now you're down to 64 attacks per turn, 128 with action surge. And how you handle diagonals might reduce that some more.

But at least Volley does force you to have ammunition and it would take a hell of quiver to hold that many arrows.

Newtons_Cradle87: It‚Äôs a popular pub quiz question, I believe I‚Äôve had it twice at least. It goes like this, ‚Äúwhich man made invention was the first to break the sound barrier?‚Äù Then it‚Äôs always followed by this clue, ‚Äúit is an ancient invention‚Äù.

stuugie: Also the coldest temperature in the known universe is here on earth
--- forrestwalker_: So my ex-girlfriend made the Guiness Book after all huh
--- Schyte96: And the hottest for quite a long distance is as well.
--- --- youllneverstopmeayyy: what is the length of heat?
--- --- --- Schyte96: Quite a long distance as is away from Earth. Experimental fusion reactors on Earth are hotter than the core of most stars bar some exceptionally large ones.
--- drewc717: Boomerang Nebula disagrees
--- --- stuugie: That's the coldest natural temperature

In lab scientists have gone to 0.0000000000038 Kelvin
--- --- --- drewc717: That's not a place. Mighty achievement of course.
--- --- --- --- Cohibaluxe: Labs aren‚Äôt a place?
--- --- --- --- --- PatHeist: Lab research is conducted safely *outside of the environment.*
--- --- --- --- --- --- Cohibaluxe: Well, the front fell off.
--- --- --- --- --- --- DBCOOPER888: It still exists inside the universe.
--- --- --- --- --- AyoRobo: Of course not, they're a dog breed.
--- --- --- --- --- deutschdachs: Is the lab constantly that temperature? Or was it just done for a period of time?

That'd be the difference between the coldest temperature in the universe is on earth (currently - implied by "is") vs the coldest temperature ever recorded was on earth (at one point in time)

Lol those downvotes... for a TIL board no one likes to learn how words work
--- --- --- --- --- --- youllneverstopmeayyy: &gt; no one likes to learn how words work

nah, you're just being an insufferable pedant 

thats what the downvotes are for
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- deutschdachs: Well there's a pretty big difference between the coldest place in the universe being on earth and the coldest temperature having been recorded here. Not really pedantry. The test was done in Bremen, Germany but no one would say the coldest place on Earth is Bremen let alone the universe.

But whatever makes folks happy
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- Adghar: Redditor refrains from launching into rant over "is" vs "was" CHALLENGE (IMPOSSIBLE)
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- deutschdachs: Fair lol
--- --- --- --- stuugie: Okay sure that occurred outside of reality I guess
--- --- --- --- stuugie: How very semantic of you

nostaljack: Guile begs to differ.
UncertainMorale: Nah it was a wet towel being  whipped.
--- goosebattle: My 1st thought too.
SeraxOfTolos: As always I would love to know where I learned this and why. Imagine a heat map of where you learned things, also imagine how blank high school would be.
--- jont76: Well, as a high school teacher, you actually learn a LOT, but it's your general knowledge. All those facts you know without thinking. 

Where did you learn the basics of English grammar?
How do you know the basics of Science?
Where did you learn Algebra? 
Where did you learn about basic nutrition? 
Basic Geography? 
Politics?
Cooking?
Basic woodwork and metalwork?
. 
. 

If you go on to upper school, this really makes a difference. 

High school is where I learnt a huge amount of facts that I use in life. 

Uni is where I honed my expertise in a few subjects (mainly Physics and Mathematics in my case).
--- --- TheySaidGetAnAlt: "Basic nutrition?"

According to my diet, nowhere as it would seem.
--- --- innergamedude: High school students: We never learn anything in school.

Also, high school students: Why are teachers always on us about paying attention and using our phones while they're talking?  If it doesn't entice me more than TikTok, it's obviously not worth considering.
--- --- IosaTheInvincible: I'm sorry but since most of my teachers were garbage, i can really say that i learn most of that by myself / being taught by friends who hired extra tutors. Even now as a Physician i still loathe my middle and highschool teachers

.

Edit : i'm glad majority of people can disagree with the statement above, at least you guys are getting decent teachers

--- --- borgendurp: &gt;Where did you learn the basics of English grammar? How do you know the basics of Science? Where did you learn Algebra? Where did you learn about basic nutrition? Basic Geography? Politics? Cooking? Basic woodwork and metalwork?

Im sorry for you because you are a teacher, but honestly, do you really believe most Americans have any understanding of any of that? Because that's borderline naive. And this isn't a teacher issue but a US school system issue.
--- --- SeraxOfTolos: My only argument is that most of that is taught throughout the schools, not just high school.

Howdy! Thank you for teaching! I really feel like you guys don't get thanked enough, you and 5th grade teachers lol.
--- --- --- BoxingSoup: I highly disagree. I think what you're experiencing is cognitive bias. Highschool was a tough time for many, and they definitely didn't pay the sort of attention highschool deserves. As such, they don't remember or appreciate what highschool tried to teach them.
--- --- --- --- SeraxOfTolos: That could be true. I won't say I'm not wrong in all of this, but I would still love that heat map somehow.
--- --- --- --- Taken450: That‚Äôs the problem with high school it starts 2 years too early.
--- --- The_Power_Of_Three: Not at school.  School consistently lagged a year or two behind learning‚Äîit was a place to *demonstrate* knowledge and thereby earn admission to college, not a place to learn.

Not that nobody learns, some do.  And of course I'm sure there a few things each person missed that could be rounded out by classroom instruction.  But in my experience going to public school, the "smart kids" were already ready to pipe up with the answers the first time a subject was brought up, and the uninterested students *still* didn't know the answers after the class was over.  The subset that did not already know the answers going in, but *did* know them a week after the final exam, were a small minority.  It wasn't until college that the subjects were specialized and detailed enough for even the 'smart kids' to need to do reading or homework.
--- -Daetrax-: Yeah it doesn't teach you trivia, but it does teach you skills.
--- --- in-game_sext: What "skills" do you learn in high school? I remember learning mostly useless trivia, like what year some stupid war was 600 years ago in a country that doesn't even exist anymore. Every useful skill that I've learned in life was not in school, and definitely not high school. Maybe in college or vocational school you'd learn skills. And sure, the mandatory years expose you to positive things like socialization, but I wouldn't say it's somewhere that you learn skills.
--- --- --- zaque_wann: Well, you definitely didn't pick up the critical thinking and analysis part. Those are skills too, really important ones. Also most schools would have taught you presentation skills, resource management and leadership skills. Hisyory should partly teach you comprehension, critical thinking and also simplified social, political and economic conditions that shaped the world and its system, culture and social structure as we know it.
--- --- --- xMrBojangles: Most normal schools teach math, science, and English in addition to history. Being able to solve math problems is a skill. Science involves tons of skills like how to measure, how to conduct an experiment, and data analysis. You learn communication and presentation skills in school. Art? Music? Secondary languages? You have to try pretty hard to walk out of high school without having learned any skills.
--- --- --- --- in-game_sext: Lol I use math in my job probably more than 90% of society (am a carpenter) and I have not once ever used algebra or calculus or any math I learned in high school...I love art and taught myself how to draw and paint. I got a D in Art in high school because the teacher said it was really good, but it was late, because I don't "make" art on the schedule that they like. Learned reading when I was young...from reading books and going to the library, and from my mom who was a school teacher for over 40 years. Learned Spanish from her too. Had a friend who learned more Spanish working a summer as field worker in high school than he did in two years at HS. Once again, high schools don't teach "skills." They teach you how to be a number and hit deadlines, if you consider that a "skill"...
--- --- --- SamGropler: I learned to use a slide rule and a computer in high school. I learned basic carpentry and wood turning in high school. I learned to sew in high school. Many kids learned to swim at school.
--- --- --- -Daetrax-: It advanced my mathematical and science skills, critical thinking, made my writing more professional/scientific, had ethics classes, lab safety, project management skills, etc. 

Without many of these attending university would've been impossible.
--- --- --- BoxingSoup: Considering you can't name the country I guess you can say you didn't learn a thing LMAO
--- --- SeraxOfTolos: I'd* would agree but I had to take pre calc....
--- --- --- MarkerMagnum: Oh no!  Pre-calc!

It‚Äôs only the fundamentals for possibly the single most important mathematical concept created by mankind.

Literally everything you touch in your daily life has probably had calculus involved in its creation.

Hell, even the basic min-max stuff you learn in pre-calc is useful when analyzing all kinds of stuff.

This is a pet peeve of mine, I‚Äôll admit.  People saying ‚ÄúI learned nothing, it was all worthless‚Äù when they never bothered to learn what it could be used for.
--- --- --- --- zaque_wann: Its also not simly just learning the maths directly, but teaches you to think in mathematical terms for your daily life, which helps a lot. Its like kicking a football around cones and running 8 laps around the filed without stopping. You're not gonna do that in a football match, but what you get from those training will be applied.
--- --- --- --- --- MarkerMagnum: True, although you almost burned my American brain out for a second.

‚ÄúWhy would anybody kick a football around cones, sounds like a real pain in the a‚Ä¶..OHH!‚Äù

I guess the ‚Äúmaths‚Äù part should have given it away, but oh well.

But yeah, it‚Äôs like practicing for a game.  Except the game is literally everything from the power coming out of your wall to the buildings you live in.
--- --- --- --- SeraxOfTolos: Most of the math I currently use I already learned before pre calc, my point was that I would love to see a heat map of where people learned things they use daily, in my personal experience I have found more people have learned useful info from their parents than any high school teacher, on average.

I know I'm wrong in my example. I don't "think" I'm wrong in principle.
--- --- --- sailor_sega_saturn: _I'd_ is short for _I would_ so you can say _I'd agree_ or _I would agree_; while _I'd would agree_ is grammatically incorrect.

But that's not as important as learning fun facts about whips so carry on.
--- --- --- --- SeraxOfTolos: Wow, I screwed up hard on that one, despite my shitty example.
Thanks though!
--- --- --- jont76: Ah, fun times. Now I teach it!
--- --- --- --- SeraxOfTolos: Hi me again. What was pre calc again?
--- --- --- --- --- jont76: A nightmare before the real nightmare of Calc!

And now, for further self flagellation, I teach both.
--- onometre: Yeah I wish high school taught about important things like whips making sonic booms and not worthless shit like history or algebra
--- --- SeraxOfTolos: Not what I meant at all. I was specifically talking about the amount of useful things that you learn at home or on the job that were never taught in school. I.E. Righty Tighty Lefty Loosey
